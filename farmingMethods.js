      <h2>Coffee Farming Methods in Uganda</h2>
      <p>Coffee farming in Uganda involves various methods to ensure optimal growth, yield, and quality of coffee beans. The specific farming methods can vary based on the type of coffee (Arabica or Robusta), the region, and the preferences of individual farmers. </p>
      <div>
        <h4>Agroforestry:</h4>
        <p>

Many coffee farmers in Uganda practice agroforestry, where coffee plants are grown alongside trees and other crops. This method provides shade for coffee plants, helps prevent soil erosion, and promotes biodiversity.</p>

        <h4>Shade Grown Coffee:</h4>
        <p>

Shade-grown coffee is common, especially in regions with high temperatures. Shade helps protect coffee plants from excessive sunlight, which can be detrimental to their growth. Additionally, shade-grown coffee often results in slower cherry ripening, contributing to better flavor development.</p>

      <div>
        <h4>Intercropping:</h4>
        <p>

Farmers often intercrop coffee with other crops such as bananas, beans, or vegetables. This diversification not only maximizes land use but also provides additional income sources for farmers.</p>

      <div>
        <h4>Terracing:</h4>
        <p>

In hilly or mountainous regions, terracing is employed to control soil erosion and conserve water. Terraces help create level surfaces for planting and prevent nutrient runoff.</p>
